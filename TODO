Todo:
  ✘ Auto update manifest.json when new sites are added @cancelled(22-08-11 19:25)
  ✘ Check if module exists before loading it, if possible @cancelled(22-05-29 12:22)
  ✔ Do not query elements in shortcuts.js if user is on the wrong page @done(22-05-27 10:44)
  ☐ Bundle code to be able to use export/import in content scripts
  ✘ Shortcuts that navigate to a new page should accept an optional 'Ctrl' key to instead open the page in a new tab @cancelled(22-08-30 19:14)
  ☐ Add runtime.onInstalled (install and update)
  ☐ Logic in Google Search 'searchResultIndex' and Youtube 'videoAnchorIndex' is similar

  ✔ Shortcuts with Ctrl, Alt collide with regular keys in object keys @done(22-08-30 19:14)
  ☐ Add being able to use shortcuts when active element is accepting input
  ☐ Correctly handle shortcut keys which are more that 1 character in length ('Escape')

  ☐ Shortcuts will only work in english keyboard locale

  ✔ Redraw icons as svg @done(22-08-22 18:46)

  ✔ When shortcut navigates to new page, figure out how to query not yet rendered elements (await for element to appear / mutation observer) @done(22-08-30 19:15)
  ☐ Force browser to draw focus outline when shortcut focuses something as if it was tabbed to with 'tab' @low (can it be done?)
  ☐ Mutation observers will stay in background if callback didn't disconnect (happens if it didn't find the queried element) @high

  ✔ Come up with better structure for shortcuts @done(22-12-17 16:08)
  ✔ Make init.js file load shortcuts.js files according to a matched location instead of separate init[site].js files @critical @done(22-12-18 16:38)
  ✔ For shotrcuts that can't have cached elements and have isAvailable function, elements will often be queried two times @done(22-12-21 16:01)
  ☐ Logic for mutation observers is done with too many outer scope variables and is hard to follow
  ☐ Use Element.closest() instead of manually traversing elements' parents @high
  ☐ Figure out if querying elelemnts in a 'query element -> query elements of that element -> ...' manner is slower than 1 querySelectorAll query @low
  ☐ When shortcut event clicks a tab, maybe also focus that tab

  ☐ Write tests?

  Browser Action:
    ✔ Browser action width doesn't fit @done(22-11-29 09:02)
    ✔ Show a hint if site has native shortcuts ('?' key) @done(22-12-21 19:02)
    ☐ Shortcuts with Ctrl, Alt modifiers render correctly
    ☐ Vertical scrollbar displays incorrectly
    ✔ Numeric shortcuts displayed first before character shortcuts @done(22-12-17 04:05)
    ✔ Highligh shortcuts that can be used on the current page (current location) @done(22-12-21 19:07)
    ☐ Opening browser action in slow @high (maybe it's always slow)

  Options:
    ✔ Extension options page @done(22-12-17 15:18)
    ☐ Show if shortcut key is uppercase (Shift+key)
    ☐ Show colliding hotkeys

    ☐ Allow user to configure scroll offset (when scrolling to an anchor for example)

  Youtube:
    ✘ Keep reference to queried elements, but also update them when page content/location changes @cancelled(22-08-31 16:50)
    ☐ Volume up/down shortcuts (in addition to standard up/down arrows)
    ☐ Fast forward/rewind shortcuts (in addition to standard 'j'/'l' keys)
    ✔ Show progress bar shortcut @done(22-08-18 13:34)
    ✔ Add go to next / previous video shortcuts (maybe) @done(23-01-05 01:34)

    ✔ Shortcuts work in all video players (not only on the /watch pages) @done(22-12-07 13:22)
    ✔ When going to channel videos/playlists from /watch page and channel home has an autoplay video, this video will start autoplaying in the background incorrectly (sometimes) @done(22-12-03 14:23)
    ✔ Improve isAvailable functions @done(22-12-21 16:00)
    ✘ Re-query null elements only when window.location.pathname changed (? maybe won't work) @cancelled(22-12-21 15:28) won't work when going from page to another page and then back to the first page without checking for pathname change on second page
    ☐ When page mutates, go to next/previous video and other focusing shortcuts are unresponsive (normal tabbing is also unresponsive)
    ✔ Rarely, when going back to /results page from any other page, go to next/previous video shortcuts stop working properly @done(22-12-29 22:41) (fix videoAnchors query returning invisible elements)
    ☐ Pages other than /results also have video anchors in different parents (home page, subscriptions page) and if only 1 such parent is loaded (which seems to only happen on /results pages but one time it has happened on /home page) when updateVideoAnchors() is run, the mutation observer will be set up incorrectly (it will only observe this first not common parent) @critical
    ☐ Add go to focused video channel

    ☐ Maybe include 'all_frames' into manifest.json content_scripts so that shortcuts also work in iframes(chat)

    Bugs:
      ☐ When channel has a 'store' tab or doesn't have a 'community' tab, 'p' (go to playlists) shortcut will incorrectly select another tab @critical

  Google Search:
    ✔ Should work not only on '.com' domains @critical @done(22-08-22 09:32)
    ✔ Make search indexes relative to the current index so that after pressing 'tab' and then pressing a shortcut it tabs to the next search result after currently focused @done(22-12-09 00:17)
    ☐ Scroll height problems (inconsistent at the bottom of the page)
    ✔ Add images shortcuts @done(22-12-09 00:17)
    ✔ Add videos shortcuts @done(22-12-09 00:17)
    ✔ Go to next/previous search result doesn't work on film pages @done(22-12-23 15:20)
    ☐ Related searches (not suggested) are separated from all search results

    ✔ Since google search pages are not dynamic, maybe don't need to write logic to update searchResults arrays when query changes @done(22-12-29 23:23)
    ✘ When page mutates, add newely added anchors to the searchResultsAnchors instead of querying all anchors again @cancelled(22-12-29 23:23)

    ☐ Show/hide shortcuts also scroll to their corresponding div

  Twitch:
    ☐ Add predictions and other chat action shortcuts
    ✔ Add isAvailable functions @done(22-12-21 19:11)

    ✔ Add go to next/previous relevant anchor @done(23-01-05 01:34)
    ☐ Make showMoreViewAll shortcut use stored elements instead of querying every time
    ☐ Add go to focused relevant anchor channel and category (for streams)

  Reddit:
